Summary:
* **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals:**  Prompt engineering involves crafting instructions and context to guide language models (LLMs) towards desired outputs.  It's crucial for optimizing LLM usage across various applications.  Key prompt components include instructions, context, input data, and output indicators.

* **Decoding Parameters:**  LLM generation is controlled by parameters like temperature (controlling randomness) and top-p (controlling token selection). Lower values produce more deterministic, less creative outputs; higher values increase diversity.

* **Advanced Prompting Techniques:**  These improve LLM performance on complex tasks.  Examples include few-shot prompting (providing examples), chain-of-thought prompting (guiding reasoning), self-consistency (selecting the most consistent answer from multiple generations), knowledge generation prompting (using generated knowledge to augment prompts), and ReAct (interleaving reasoning and actions).

* **Prompt Engineering Risks:**  Concerns include prompt injection (malicious commands overriding intended instructions), prompt leaking (revealing prompt details), and jailbreaking (bypassing safety features).

* **Program-Aided Language Models (PAL):** PAL uses LLMs to generate programs as intermediate reasoning steps, offloading computation to external runtimes for complex tasks.
